Implementation of  ROT47
Written by RafaÅ‚ Wilk
 14.04.2021

The ROT47 (Caesar cipher by 47 chars) is a simple character substitution cipher that replaces
a character within the ASCII range [33, 126] with the character 47 character after it (rotation)
in the ASCII table. It is an invertible algorithm i.e. applying the same algorithm to the input
twice will get the origin text.
